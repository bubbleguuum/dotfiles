# dotfiles

This config elaborated on openSUSE Tumbleweed starts:

- i3 if login on tty1 console
- Plasma if login on tty2 console
- Plasma  + i3 (replacing kwin) on tty3 console

It's also compatible with Display Managers.

It is tweaked for a 27" 4K screen, using 192dpi for fonts and 2x scaling for Plasma.

It uses some common shortcuts between i3 and Plasma for muscle memory.
